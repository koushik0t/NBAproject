Analyzing NBA data.
This repository is contains my project, which analyzes NBA data of the past decade, in attempt to predict which teams are the most successful, with a creation of an aggregate scoring system.
Further work can be done to improve this scoring system, or analyze something else entirely, since results concluded this scoring statistic was not effective for predicting win or loss.
